// VerifyingSource answers from one source while checking it against another.
//
// Replacing a neutral public database with a richer source trades a known trust
// root for a new one, and introduces a threat the public database does not
// have. Poisoning by addition — an invented vulnerability — is noisy and
// eventually noticed. Denial by omission is silent: a source that withholds a
// real CVE produces a clean scan, and nothing downstream can distinguish "no
// vulnerability" from "not told about the vulnerability".
//
// So the superset claim is checked on every lookup rather than trusted. The
// intelligence source answers; the reference source is asked the same question;
// the difference is classified:
//
//   - the reference has a record the intelligence source did not return —
//     SUPPRESSION. Reported loudly, and the record is still returned, so a
//     failing source degrades trust without ever costing a finding.
//   - the intelligence source has records the reference does not — the added
//     value, carried through with its own status.
//   - the reference could not be reached — the property was not checked, which
//     is reported as such rather than passing for a clean verification.
//
// The zero value is not usable; construct with NewVerifying.
