// Package vulnsource is the seam between nox's dependency analysis and whatever
// answers the question "is this package version known to be vulnerable?".
//
// Nox has always asked that question over the network — core/analyzers/deps has
// queried api.osv.dev by default since dependency scanning existed. What keeps
// nox offline-first is not the absence of network code but three properties
// this package is built to preserve:
//
//  1. the capability is switchable off;
//  2. a failed lookup degrades loudly, never into a silent clean scan;
//  3. nothing downstream depends on a source having answered.
//
// A Source implementation owns its own wire protocol entirely. Batching limits,
// ecosystem vocabularies, detail hydration, and the quirks of a particular API
// are implementation business; this package defines only the semantic contract.
//
// # Record shape
//
// Record is deliberately OSV-wire-compatible, json tags included. OSV's schema
// is the interchange baseline every source must be able to speak, which is what
// makes a richer source verifiable against a reference one rather than merely
// asserted to be a superset of it. Sources with more to say extend Record; they
// do not reshape it.
